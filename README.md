# KDTree
Kdtree Implementation with pure python
## Dependency:
    You don't need any dependency for KDTree itself but if you want to check the algorithm on a dataset(e.g MNIST) you should have pandas and numpy for easier process
    
    
 On the other side of project you have KNN Classifier which you can use to solve KNN problems on Machine Learning
